# Alpha-Frontiers-Hexarealm

I love Alpha Frontiers!

But I do not love FantasyHex tiles

The solution? Alpha Frontiers Hexarealm!

# Goal
The goal for this mod is that when you are playing Alpha Frontiers using the Hexarealm tileset it feels like a consistent sci-fi experience

# Process
I'm going to start with the terrain tiles as that'll make the most difference. 

And with any buildings that look out of place

The plan is to where possible take the tiles from Unciv and restyle them using the colour schemes from Alpha Frontiers Fantasyhex where it makes sense

At the moment I'm not planning on upscaling anything that does work, like resource tiles, but we'll see in the future.
