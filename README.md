# Alpha-Frontiers-Hexarealm

I love Alpha Frontiers!

But I don't love FantasyHex tiles

The solution Alpha Frontiers Hexarealm

# Goal
I'm going to start with all the terrain tiles as that'll make the most difference. 

And with any buildings that look out of place

# Process
The plan is to where possible take the tiles from Unciv and restyle them using the colour schemes from Alpha Frontiers Fantasyhex

# Progress 
Desert Tiles - In progress
Plain - Not started
Grasslands - Not Started

Anything else - Not started
