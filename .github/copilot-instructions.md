# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Alpha-Frontiers-Hexarealm

## Tileset Image Requirements

All tileset images (tiles and edges in `Images.Tilesets/TileSets/HexaRealm/`) must adhere to the following specifications:

### Dimensions
- **All images must be exactly 64 × 56 pixels**

### Background
- **All images must have a transparent background**

### Style
- **All images must have a pixelated style that matches the Unciv HexaRealm tileset**
- Maintain consistency with existing HexaRealm tileset assets
- Follow the sci-fi aesthetic appropriate for an alien planet colonization theme
- Keep pixel art style consistent with the base Unciv HexaRealm tileset

These requirements ensure visual consistency across all tileset assets and proper integration with the Unciv game engine.

**Note:** These specifications apply specifically to tileset images (tiles and edges). Other images such as splash screens, previews, or atlas files may have different requirements.
