## We Need Pixel Artists!

Are you passionate about pixel art? Do you want to see your creative work featured in a strategy game? We're looking for talented pixel artists to help us create and improve the visual assets of Alpha-Frontiers-Hexarealm.

### What We're Looking For

- **Tile Art**: Terrain, water, structures, resources, etc.
- **Buildings & Units**: All buildinds need an overhaul, all units too
- **Wonders**: All wonders need updating

### How to Get Started

1. **Check Existing Art**
   - Look at the `/Images` folders to see our current style.
   - Open an issue if you have questions about specific assets or style guidelines.

2. **Propose Your Contribution**

   - Suggest improvements, new features, or fixes for existing art.

3. **Submit Your Work**
   - Fork the repo and create a new branch for your art assets.
   - Add your pixel art (in PNG format, with transparent backgrounds if needed) to the appropriate directory.
   - Make sure your files are clearly named and organized.
   - Test your work by running the github actions, and then add the branch to your game. ( The map editor is the best way of testing things )
   - Submit a pull request with a clear description and sample images in the PR comment.
  
4. **Feedback & Iteration**
   - The community and maintainers will review your contribution.
   - Be ready to discuss, iterate, and refine your art as needed.
