### Unciv HexaRealm Tileset

Many images in this tileset are derived from the [Unciv](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv) HexaRealm tileset:

- Some images are used directly without modification
- Some images have been modified with new color schemes inspired by Alpha Frontiers
- All adapted images maintain the original HexaRealm pixel art style

The original Unciv HexaRealm tileset is available at: https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv

### Alpha Frontiers FantasyHex

The color schemes and sci-fi aesthetic used in modified tiles are inspired by the [Alpha Frontiers](https://github.com/carriontrooper/Alpha-Frontier) FantasyHex tileset by:

- [Indonesian Gentleman (Carriontrooper)](https://github.com/carriontrooper) - original tileset creator

Alpha Frontiers is available at: https://github.com/carriontrooper/Alpha-Frontier

## Purpose

This tileset combines the pixel art style of Unciv's HexaRealm with the sci-fi color palette and aesthetics from Alpha Frontiers FantasyHex to create a consistent visual experience when playing Alpha Frontiers with the HexaRealm tileset.
